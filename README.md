# WhatIsThatPlace

A simple Android application that works in combination with [WhatIsThatPlace](https://github.com/timonback/WhatisthatPlace-Proxy).

It shows additional information for images you have taken - most importantly the location (if the underlying service [Google Vision API]) is able to detect it.
