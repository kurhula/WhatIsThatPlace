# WhatIsThatPlace

A simple Android application that works in combination with [WhatIsThatPlace-Proxy](https://github.com/timonback/WhatisthatPlace-Proxy).

It shows additional information for images you have taken - most importantly the location (if the underlying service [Google Vision API]) is able to detect it.

## Screenshots

MainView | DetailView
------------ | -------------
The MainView gets shown right after the app gets opened. It is a browseable list of all images on the phone ordered by date. | The DetailView shows all image related information - especially the place. In this case Martinitoren in Groningen, The Netherlands.
